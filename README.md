# Planet Simulation

This project is a simulation of our solar system. It uses the Pygame library to create a graphical representation of the planets and their movements.

## Features

- Graphical representation of the sun and four closest planets (Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars).
- Realistic movement of the planets due to gravitational forces.
- Display of the distance of each planet from the sun.

## Installation

To install the required libraries, use pip:

```bash
pip install pygame
```

## Usage

To run the simulation, execute the `master.py` file:

```bash
python master.py
```
